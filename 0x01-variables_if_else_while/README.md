0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing : This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
<br /> You can find the source code here
<br /> The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
<br /> You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
<br /> The output of the program should be:
  <br /> - The number, followed by
    <br /> 1. if the number is greater than 0: is positive
    <br /> 2. if the number is 0: is zero
    <br /> 3. if the number is less than 0: is negative
  <br /> - followed by a new line.
  
1. The last digit : This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
<br /> You can find the source code here
<br /> The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
<br /> You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
<br /> The output of the program should be:
  <br /> - The string Last digit of, followed by
  <br /> - n, followed by
  <br /> - the string is, followed by
